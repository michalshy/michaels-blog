Never ever\nbefore I was considering this sector as my carrer. I found it boring. This was,\nobviously due to very poorly structurized classes in highschool where teachers tried\nto introduce us to C++ by showing \u003cstrong\u003eThe bubble sort algorithm!\u003c/strong\u003e Terrifying.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor me, love to programing appeared instantly in collage. My first exercise was to\nimplement basic KNN classifier. But it is not that fascinating. Moving forward,\nwe were later said to produce anything we want in any graphic library with use of SFML.\nI had to find \u003cem\u003ethe idea\u003c/em\u003e. I could\u0026rsquo;ve produced anything, but the goal was to do\nsomething I will be proud of.\nThat is when I found this \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GQNPJip2Y\u0026amp;list=PLPiMlUuvmixC-R-5DXE6k2P6FdKn71JGY\"\u003eYoutube video\u003c/a\u003e.\nThis ant colony simulator was a masterpiece of software creation for someone with\nsuch a poor skills as mine.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s enough of this short introduction.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe conclusion, I did terrible.\u003cbr\u003e\nResult was an OOP application created with C++ and SFML, developed in Visual Studio.\nI was not satisfied with result, and this is why now I will tried to change it.\nDuring my development of this simulator, I will try to show you some cool stuff in the project.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"funny c++ simulation"},{"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/first/","summary":"","title":"First"},{"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/archive/","summary":"archive","title":"archive"}]
