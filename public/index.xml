      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-idea&#34;&gt;The idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When i started attending collage, so did my programming journey began. Never ever
before I was considering this sector as my carrer. I found it boring. This was,
obviously due to very poorly structurized classes in highschool where teachers tried
to introduce us to C++ by showing &lt;strong&gt;The bubble sort algorithm!&lt;/strong&gt; Terrifying.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For me, love to programing appeared instantly in collage. My first exercise was to
implement basic KNN classifier. But it is not that fascinating. Moving forward,
we were later said to produce anything we want in any graphic library with use of SFML.
I had to find &lt;em&gt;the idea&lt;/em&gt;. I could&amp;rsquo;ve produced anything, but the goal was to do
something I will be proud of.
That is when I found this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GQNPJip2Y&amp;amp;list=PLPiMlUuvmixC-R-5DXE6k2P6FdKn71JGY&#34;&gt;Youtube video&lt;/a&gt;.
This ant colony simulator was a masterpiece of software creation for someone with
such a poor skills as mine.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I think it&amp;rsquo;s enough of this short introduction.&lt;br&gt;
The conclusion, I did terrible.&lt;br&gt;
Result was an OOP application created with C++ and SFML, developed in Visual Studio.
I was not satisfied with result, and this is why now I will tried to change it.
During my development of this simulator, I will try to show you some cool stuff in the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
